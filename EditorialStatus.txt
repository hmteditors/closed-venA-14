Status of Iliad 14

Scholia Index
- complete except for intermarginal scholia on 185r (placeholders C9, C10, C11, C12, C13)


Other Issues
- verify that every scholion has a urn reference to the line it comments on (particularly exterior scholia seem to be missing them)
- The interlinear scholia that show elided letters were probably not indexed and edited
